# Squad 2: Offer Generation

# TODO: Implement the RAG knowledge base for job offers.
# This includes the script to load/process documents into ChromaDB.

# TODO: Implement Tool 5: job_offer_generator_tool(prompt)
# This function should take a simple prompt (e.g., "junior python dev") and use the RAG pipeline to generate a full job offer.
