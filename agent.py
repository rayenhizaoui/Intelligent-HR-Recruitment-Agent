# TODO: Define the LangGraph AgentState (TypedDict) here.
# It should include keys like 'chat_history', 'current_job_description', 'candidate_list', etc.

# TODO: Implement the main LangGraph router logic.
# This node will decide which tool to call next (e.g., 'cv_parser', 'ranker', 'offer_generator').

# TODO: Wire all the tool nodes and the router into the final compiled agent graph.
